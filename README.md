### Overview

Zillow will often indicate "Estimated home price" to inform users about the market rates of homes, even when they are not yet explicitly for sale. More accurate depictions of home values translates to more confidence in Zillow's product, and will therefore grow their user base (translating to more advertising revenue).

I built this model which will make the best possible prediction of home values in Ames, Iowa taking the follwoing steps.

**Define the project**
**Import and explore the data**
**EDA and data cleaning**
**Model developement**
**Evaluate the results**

For this project we tried linear regression, lasso  and ridge.

In the presentation we have visuals, and important descriptions of the dataset.

In this model we used (Garage area, total basement sf, bedroom, street type, overall quality, living area, number of full bath and yeare remodlled) as features.
